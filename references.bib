	Abstract = {Evidence for the radial motion of trapped particles was reviewed by F{\"a}lthammar (1970). Many experimental results of a varied nature support the contention that particles diffuse across L shells, even in magnetically quiet periods. During magnetically active periods more violent changes in the trapped radiation population take place, indicating that strong acceleration and/or injection is occurring. These impulsive events will be ignored in this paper, and only the gradual diffusive motion will be considered. In the diffusive motion it is generally assumed that the radial velocity caused by the perturbing electric and magnetic fields is small compared to the normal azimuthal drift velocity. Thus, the diffusive motion can be described by a Fokker-Planck equation such as derived by Haerendel (1968). The role of this slow type of diffusion in the overall formation and decay of the radiation belts is uncertain at the present time. However, if the magnitude and characteristics of the process can be established, its importance can be evaluated.},

	Abstract = {As long as it remains trapped within the earth's magnetosphere, a radiation-belt particle of mass m and charge q typically executes a hierarchy of three distinct forms of quasi-periodic motion. The most rapid of these is gyration about a field line at frequency $\Omega$1/2$\pi$ = −qB/2 $\pi$mc, where B is the local magnetic-field intensity and c is the speed of light. The instantaneous center of the gyration orbit is known as the particle's guiding center. An average over gyration reveals an oscillation of the guiding center between magnetic mirror points, which are located at a pair of well-defined positions along a path that very nearly coincides with the original field line. This periodic bounce motion between mirror points proceeds at a frequency $\Omega$2/2$\pi${\textasciitilde}$\upsilon$/2$\pi$S, where $\upsilon$ is the speed of the particle and S is the arc length of the entire field line. Finally, an average over the bounce motion reveals an azimuthal drift of the guiding-center trajectory. This drift motion generates a shell encircling the earth; complete circuits of this shell are accomplished at the drift frequency $\Omega$3/2$\pi${\textasciitilde} <$\upsilon$2/2$\pi$$\Omega$1S2>, where the angle brackets denote an average over the entire particle orbit.},
